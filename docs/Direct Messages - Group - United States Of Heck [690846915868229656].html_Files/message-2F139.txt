Rules
Read These often, because all of these rules are SUBJECT TO CHANGE

Most of these rules are enforced by the @MEE6 bot. For 10 warns, your muted for an hour, same with 20, with 2 hours, and etc. Once you reach 50 warns, those mutes turn into temp bans, 60 warns = 1 hour ban, and it goes on. After 100 warns, you get one more chance before you are banned from the server

1. Make sure your using the appropriate channel before you send a message
2. No Swearing
3. No Spamming (Including Excessive mentions)

The @MEE6 bot may not always be accurate, so if you believe you have been wrongfully warned, DM me @JMTNTBANG

Every 100th person will get a special role, @The Huneds 
Every 1,000th person will get a special role @The Thounds 
Every 10,000th person will get a special role @The Tin Thounds 
Every 100,000th person will get a special role @The Huned Thounds 
Every 1,000,000th person will get a special role @The Milons 

Don't Try to be smart and leave and rejoin, I can use the #mee6-announcements channel to see what number you really are
